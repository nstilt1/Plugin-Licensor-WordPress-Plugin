# Plugin-Licensor-WordPress-Plugin
This is currently undergoing development. Just trying to connect the licensing back end with the store's back end, then a get request for the license code.

The license creation and fetching should work, but there could be bugs. Right now, the licensing is only implemented for any individual company to sell their own products on their store. It isn't set up for them to easily sell other companies' products on their store. It is possible, and I can make it easier to do that later, but for now, it will mainly be for individual companies.
