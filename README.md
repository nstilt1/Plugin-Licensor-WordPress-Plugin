# Plugin-Licensor-WordPress-Plugin
This is currently undergoing development. Just trying to connect the licensing back end with the store's back end, then a get request for the license code.

The license creation should work, but there could be bugs. Next up: getting the license code from the server with a function that can be called from Woocommerce's email editor. Then I'll have to test it.
