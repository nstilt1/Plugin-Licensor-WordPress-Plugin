/* Write a WordPress plugin in PHP for WooCommerce that sends a POST request to https://api.pluginlicensor.com/v1/create_license when a purchase is made. The body of the POST request needs a string parameter called "products" that is made by looping over the items in the order, and if the item has an attribute called "plugin_id", then the value of that attribute will be appended to the "products" string, followed by a comma.
