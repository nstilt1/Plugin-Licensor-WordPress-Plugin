This service is using a "Pay what you want" business model.

= How much does this service cost you, Hyperformance Solutions? =

It costed me about 9+ months or so, and each API request costs a fraction of a penny.
The website costs a minimum of $0.50/month, plus the domain name costs. So, it did not cost much money, but it did cost a lot of time.

== Changelog ==

* Basic implementation that allows licenses to be created and retrieved.

== Upcoming Updates ==

= 1.1 =
Adds a UI for the user to view and manage machines on their licenses, as well as to generate a new license code if they shared it with the wrong person.
This is not yet implemented, and the license code regeneration will not be allowed for free plugins.
